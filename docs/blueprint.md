## Core Features:

- File Import: Import an .xcstrings file from your file system.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A soft sky blue (#87CEEB), reflecting a sense of calmness and reliability.
- Background color: Light off-white (#F9F9F9) to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: A deeper, more saturated blue (#4682B4), analogous to the primary hue but clearly distinct. This will guide users to calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font known for its modern and neutral appearance.
- Use a consistent set of minimalistic icons, with line weights appropriate to the weight of the 'Inter' font, for actions and navigation.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout, leveraging whitespace to avoid clutter and improve the user experience.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading states and user interactions to provide feedback without being distracting.
